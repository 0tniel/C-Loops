<br> <p align='center'><b>Printing Numbers from 1 to 20</b></p>

## Aim

To print the numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop in C++.

## Software Used
- Dev C++

## Theory

<p>
  A while loop in C++ is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. In this program, a while loop is utilized to print numbers sequentially from 1 to 20.
</p>

### While Loop
<p>
  The while loop checks the condition before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. The condition in this program is i < 20, which means the loop will continue to run as long as i is less than 20.
</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start. <br> 
Step 2: Initialize a variable i with the value 0. <br> 
Step 3: Enter the while loop with the condition i < 20. <br> 
Step 4: Inside the loop, print the value of i + 1. <br> 
Step 5: Increment i by 1 to move to the next number. <br> 
Step 6: Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the condition i < 20 becomes false. <br> 
Step 7: End. <br>

## Conclusion

The program successfully prints the numbers from 1 to 20 using a while loop. This demonstrates the basic usage of the while loop for iterative operations in C++.

## Aim

To print the numbers from 1 to 20 using a do-while loop in C++.

## Software Used

- Dev C++

## Theory

<p>
  A do-while loop in C++ is used to execute a block of code at least once and then repeat the execution as long as a specified condition remains true. The key difference from a while loop is that a do-while loop guarantees at least one iteration of the loop body before checking the condition.
</p>

## Algorithm

Step 1: Start. <br> Step 2: Initialize a variable a with the value 1. <br> Step 3: Enter the do-while loop. <br> Step 4: Inside the loop, print the value of a followed by a space. <br> Step 5: Increment a by 1. <br> Step 6: Check if a is less than or equal to 20. If true, repeat steps 4 and 5. <br> Step 7: If false, exit the loop and print a newline. <br> Step 8: End. <br>
